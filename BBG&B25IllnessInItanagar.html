<h2>It was a long uncomfortable slog to Itanagar. By the time I got there it was 7 pm and I was a run-down basket case. My flue had intensified.  Two days rest in Aalo had not been sufficient to kick whatever I had caught in the cramped quarters of the shared jeeps. The 14 hours journey to Itanagar did not help things. The jeep dropped me off on yet another dusty road under construction. I stood in a daze outside a hotel in this capital city. I did not note much about it in my addles date. I was in now deep into survival mode and had been for the better half of the week. What I did notice was that all the roads seemed in horrible shape and road construction seemed to be going one everywhere.

<h2>Thankfully my airbnb host in Itanagar, Pema, had promised to pick me up. I waited for him on the side of the road in front of a mid-level hotel. I used what remained of my strength and composure to keep myself upright and be cordial with some young ladies who noted my [conspicuous] presence on the roadside. I submitted to their requests for a few selfies. I can only imagine how those turned out. Soon enough Pema arrived and took me in his car to the booking. On the outside it was ramshackle apartment that was also under construction. Inside it was a lot better but given the general condition of the place I took what remained of my strength to  haggle him down on the price of accommodation before settling in.

<h2>Fortunately Pema turned out to be very bright and attentive. He brought me soups and food from restaurants and called to check in on me when needed. Honestly I was in such bad shape I think he was worried I would expire in his rental. The first night I pulled out my med kit and took my temperature. It was 103 degrees and borderline dangerous. I followed my medical bookâ€™s guidelines for reducing fever and prayed that night that I would not die alone in an airbnb rental in Itanagar. Thankfully my prayers were answered and the next morning my fever had dropped below 100.   I ended up staying in that apartment in for about six days and did not go out. So, unfortunately, I can offer little insight or information about Itanagar.  On the last day my host, Pema, took me to a temple in town that also functioned as a sort of park for locals (including monkeys).  In all the truth is I had been very lucky to find Pema and his guesthouse. He was a business man but had a caring side and had been looking out for me. Thank you Pema!</h2></div>
