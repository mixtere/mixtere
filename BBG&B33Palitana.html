<h2>In seeking out Palitana I was, as usual, trying to avoid the typical tourist track. Reading about the 3000-plus steps to thousands of Jain temples sprinkled in the hills above Palitana sounded too good to pass up. The ride from Ahmedabad turned out to be one of only a handful overnight busses that I took in India. Allow me to attempt to describe these busses in greater detail. It has the shell of a Greyhound bus, but inside it is converted into individual sections with “beds” and sliding panels for privacy. I found myself feeling quite stuffy and claustrophobic in my little cubby. I am too long to be able to lay flat, even laying diagonally. This is a common occurrence for tall people traveling in developing countries. Things like bus cubbies, sinks, showers, doorways, vehicle and train seating arrangements are designed for the average height of a person in that area (short).

<h2>People say that being tall is this great thing that they wished they had been granted but it is also a source of major difficulty in many regards. In addition to transportation these things include finding clothing that fits, walking through doorways, sitting at tables that allow clearance for your legs, walking down steps designed for shorter legs or attempting to sleep in beds designed for someone half the size. Being tall also really prevents one from blending in a sea of people that are about a foot shorter. One’s pale, often sunburned skin or light hair act as a flag atop the flagpole of the foreigner. This does not create a low-profile scenario.

<h2>Anyway, the bus dumped me off in Palitana and I did a double-take. I didn’t sense that I was in a town. I asked a local if this was in fact Palitana. He insisted that it was. The place was flat, dusty, sparsely populated and reminded me the most of the Bodh Gaya I had known from the 90’s, except not nearly as lively. I started to look for accommodation and someone at some point made the suggestion of a government-run hotel in the center of town. The folk there received me graciously and soon I was given a rather deluxe and spacious room on the third floor for what I recall was about 1200 rupees. The hotel complex was pretty empty and I think at that time I was the only person on the third floor.

<h2>This, combined with the dusty lanes and drab, scrubby desert scenery exacerbated the sense of isolation I was feeling as a foreigner in that land. My time in Kovalam was not that far behind me and my new environment more resembled Mars than any of my previous haunts. The hotel sat in a sort of compound, one that no one in the town save staff and visiting lodgers dared to enter. This added to the sense of isolation. It is probably a good thing that I was required to go out into the streets to find meals or otherwise I may have died of loneliness or disappeared into the dusty, creaky folds of that compound, never to return.

<h2>Much of Gujarat is Jain, a lesser known religion that I know very little of. I have heard that Jains attempt to prevent from killing any living things, to the point where they may even stay at home during rainy times to prevent disturbing living beings in the soil. If Jain readers stumble upon this, please understand, I am making no claim to understand your faith and am clearly quite ignorant about most of it. I write about my experience, not about my mastery of Indian cultures and history. There are recognized scholars and journalists with whole teams of fact-checkers for that. This effort is a document of my experience seeking adventure and being free to direct oneself toward that end. And all of this is funded by me, not a corporate sponsor. I feel that is a very rare thing these days.

<h2>For me a glaring fact about being in Palitana was a shortage of protein and proliferation of sugar in the Jain diet. I could not get curd, milk, eggs or cheese. The dal served me was sweet and none too pleasing to the palate. But much of Asia adds sugar to things, such as meals or tea, which I feel would be better without it. But when in Rome… well, you know. The shortage of substantial sustenance led to me wandering around in a semi-anemic state. My raging metabolism was not getting enough fuel to run itself. During my time in Palitana I managed to get by on the veg offerings. The nasty, sweet "Veg Manchurian" was the primary one of those. As far as I could tell it was cauliflower fried in a sweet batter and served with a sweet tomato hinted sauce.

<h2>The morning after landing at the government hotel I took a rickshaw to the foot of the gargantuan staircase leading to the temples on the hill. The way I remember it is that there were over 3000 stairs and over 30,000 shrines and temples at the top. Unfortunately on this pilgrimage route there were strict rules that prohibited the taking of photos. I did manage to sneak a couple in but I felt guilty about it. One time a guy caught me and insisted I put the camera away. One rule the staff of the site did look past was the requirement that those that ascend the stairs have no food or water, a way of sanctifying the arduous journey up the mountain. I am glad they looked past this rule as they would have likely had a passed-out foreigner crisping to a finish in the hot sun. I think somehow they knew this and had bent the rules accordingly.

<h2>Gradually I ascended from the dry desert floor. Bit by bit elevation was gained and calories and sweat lost. I am a relatively fit person that likes to walk but by no means am I an exercise freak. It is rare when I find physical feats that the general public engages in to be difficult. But those stairs were something else. Many a pilgrim hired locals to carry them in a livery up and down the stairs. Talk about back-breaking work!  But for these carried folk, who were often elders seeking to complete the pilgrimage, the livery was the only option to get to the temples. And based on the number of porters going up and down the stairs and the number of times I was hounded with offers for these services, it seemed that livery-carrying was big business in Palitana.
</h2></div>
<div class="column">
 <!-- Text -->
<h2>I pressed on up the stairs. Soon occasional groves of trees appeared beside the narrow stairs of that interminable staircase. I found myself huffing and puffing and seeking shade from the rare  tree. About a halfway up my breakfast began talking to me and became adamant that I take a potty break. I panicked. What exactly was I to do? With each step the coming business became more urgent. I contemplated my options and none of them were good. Soon I was beyond denial. I needed a "haircut" wicked bad. I began timing my walking as to try to distance myself as much as possible from hiking pilgrims below and above. I had my eyes on the parched grove of trees to my right. When the moment presented itself I fled to the shrubbery post-haste. I tried to insert myself deep enough into the woods to conceal myself. Once there I discovered that I was not the only one that had been presented with this dilemma. I made it quick and guiltily got back onto the staircase just as a group emerged up the stairs. So much for keeping a low profile. 
</h2></div>
<div class="column">
<!-- Text -->
<h2>Up and up the staircase went. I cursed my sense of adventure. The stairs wound up the hills and rises, plateaued for flat spells, then wound and climbed some more. I encountered a group of young men carrying an empty livery back down for a fresh load. These men were gracious enough to stop for a photo or two with me. I really like the expression on one of their faces. See for yourself on the "Selfie with a Foreigner" page. With my hips and legs burning by the time I was 2/3 of the way up, the last 1/3 was torture. Finally I alighted upon a hilltop sprinkled with countless shrines and temples. But the ascent was like many mountain hikes I have taken. Just when I thought I was there the new level brought the realization that there was another ridge above, more stairs to go, and then ladders- up, up and around and through the countless temples. I realized that I was not going to see all 30+ thousand shrines or whatever the official number is. The torturous hike had settled this matter for me. Still, it was an awe-inspiring sight from up there. I did manage to snap a clandestine photo or two before I was scolded for doing so.

<h2>In no time I was finding myself beyond wiped out and dreading the descent of the staircase. My legs and hips were already aching and burning as it was. But either out of cheapness or sense of pride, I decided that there was to be no livery for me. There was nothing for it but to grit my teeth and begin the steps down, and down and down. I found myself learning whole new approaches to descending stairs in an attempt to use different muscles and give the sore ones a break. Techniques I employed were to descend the stairs diagonally, to skip stairs to try to limit movement and to even walk down the stairs backwards to give my leg muscles a variety of workout. None of this really worked very well. On and on I went and then finally I rounded the bend and sighted the foot of the stairs and the beginning of the town.

<h2>Relief washed over me. I hailed a rickshaw immediately and asked about a local restaurant. The driver took me to one and I sat and breathed and ate and spaced out to an anemic haze in the cool shady building. Then it was back to the hotel to rest. My body was sore for two whole weeks, my muscles still smarting and rebuilding long after leaving Gujarat! Palitana was a unique experience but it and Ahmedabad did not inspire me to continue touring Gujarat. The distances were far greater and the land less compelling than I had anticipated. Additionally, I felt run down by the Jain meal offerings and their lack of protein. And so I never made it to the coast. I returned to Ahmedabad with the goal of continuing north to see a bit of Rajasthan. Train tickets were unavailable so I booked another bus (not a sleeper) and headed for Udaipur.
